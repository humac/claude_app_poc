## 🎨 2026 Design System

ACS features a modern design system emphasizing spatial depth, semantic opacity, and data-rich bento layouts.

### Design Philosophy

**Spatial Depth** - UI elements exist on three distinct layers:
- **Floor** (z-index: 0): Ambient background with subtle gradients and `floor` class
- **Surface** (z-index: 1-10): Glass-panel containers with backdrop blur using `glass-panel` or `bento-card` classes
- **Overlay** (z-index: 50): Floating modals and popovers using `glass-overlay` class

**Semantic Opacity** - Colors communicate meaning through alpha transparency with glowing status indicators:
- `glow-success` - Active/positive states with green shadow
- `glow-warning` - Caution states with orange shadow
- `glow-destructive` - Error/lost states with red shadow
- `glow-info` - Informational states with blue shadow
- `glow-muted` - Inactive/returned states

**Bento Grids** - Non-linear, modular layouts for data-heavy dashboards with interactive hover effects.

**Micro-interactions** - Subtle animations provide feedback:
- Buttons scale on hover (`btn-interactive`)
- Cards lift with shadow elevation
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Entrance animations (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-scale-in`)

### Key Components

- **Glass Morphism**: Backdrop-blur cards and overlays for modern depth
- **Gradient Text**: Large headings use `text-gradient` for visual hierarchy
- **Icon Boxes**: Consistent icon containers (`icon-box-sm/md/lg`)
- **Status Badges**: Pill-shaped with glowing shadows
- **Loading States**: Shimmer effects for skeleton loading
- **Typography**: Bold, condensed headings with `caption-label` for metadata

See [UI-MODERNIZATION-SUMMARY.md](UI-MODERNIZATION-SUMMARY.md) and [UI-UX-DESIGN-SPEC.md](UI-UX-DESIGN-SPEC.md) for complete design documentation.

## 🖥️ Platform Support

This application supports multiple architectures:
- **x86_64/AMD64** - Intel/AMD processors (standard servers, desktop)
- **ARM64** - ARM processors (Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon)

Docker images are automatically built for both platforms during CI/CD.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

**For Development:**
- **Node.js 22.x LTS** (required for backend native modules like better-sqlite3)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

**For Production Deployment:**
- Docker and Docker Compose

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### For Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/humac/acs.git
cd acs

# 2. Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
cp ../.env.example .env
# Edit .env and set JWT_SECRET (required)
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
npm run dev  # starts API on http://localhost:3001

# 3. Frontend setup (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if needed (default BACKEND_URL is http://localhost:3001)
npm run dev   # starts UI on http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** Frontend requires a `.env` file with `BACKEND_URL`. See `frontend/.env.example` for the example configuration.

- First registered account becomes **Admin** automatically (or set `ADMIN_EMAIL` in backend `.env`).
- For full backend configuration options, see `backend/.env.example`.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Building Docker Images

```bash
# Build backend image
cd backend
docker build -t acs-backend .

# Build frontend image
cd frontend
docker build -t acs-frontend .
```

### Running with Docker Compose (SQLite)

Use this for single-server deployments with SQLite database:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access at http://localhost:80
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:3001
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

### Running with Docker Compose (PostgreSQL)

Use this for deployments requiring PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Start the application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d

# Access at http://localhost:80
```

The `docker-compose.postgres.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=acs
      - POSTGRES_USER=acs_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      - DB_CLIENT=postgres
      - POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://acs_user:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/acs
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:3001
    depends_on:
      - backend

volumes:
  postgres-data:
```

### Running Individual Containers

If you prefer to run containers individually:

```bash
# Run backend with SQLite
docker run -d \
  --name acs-backend \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  acs-backend

# Run frontend
docker run -d \
  --name acs-frontend \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e BACKEND_URL=http://backend:3001 \
  --link acs-backend:backend \
  acs-frontend
```

### Environment Configuration

**Backend** - See `backend/.env.example` for all configuration options:
- `JWT_SECRET` - **Required** - Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `DB_CLIENT` - Database type: `sqlite` (default) or `postgres`
- `POSTGRES_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (if using PostgreSQL)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Optional admin user email
- `OIDC_ENABLED` - Enable SSO/OIDC authentication
- `PASSKEY_ENABLED` - Enable WebAuthn/Passkey support
- `RUN_ATTESTATION_SCHEDULER` - Enable automated attestation reminders

**Frontend** - See `frontend/.env.example`:
- `BACKEND_URL` - Backend API URL (e.g., `http://backend:3001`)

### Email Notifications Setup

Email notifications (password reset, attestation campaigns) require SMTP configuration via **Admin Settings → Notifications**.

1. **Generate Master Encryption Key** (required for password encryption at rest):
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```

2. **Add to backend `.env`**:
   ```bash
   ACS_MASTER_KEY=your-generated-key-here
   ```

3. **Configure SMTP** from Admin Settings UI (host, port, TLS, credentials)

4. **Test** with "Send Test Email" button

### Database Backup and Restore

**Backup SQLite database:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/acs-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .
```

**Restore from backup:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar xzf /backup/acs-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C /data
```

### Additional Configuration

For advanced features, see `backend/.env.example`:

- **Attestation Scheduler**: `RUN_ATTESTATION_SCHEDULER=true` - Automated reminders and escalations
- **Proxy Settings**: `TRUST_PROXY=true` and `PROXY_TYPE=cloudflare|standard|none` - For reverse proxy deployments
- **Rate Limiting**: `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` - Protect against abuse
- **SSO/OIDC**: `OIDC_ENABLED=true` plus issuer/client configuration
- **Passkeys**: `PASSKEY_ENABLED=true` plus RP ID/name/origin configuration

---

## 📧 Email Notification Workflows

ACS includes a comprehensive email notification system for password reset workflows and attestation campaigns. All email notifications require SMTP configuration (see "Email Notifications Setup" above). Email templates are fully customizable via **Admin Settings → Notifications → Email Templates**.

**Note:** When `RUN_ATTESTATION_SCHEDULER=true` is enabled, the scheduler runs daily automated checks for reminders, escalations, and campaign closures.

### 1. Password Reset Flow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Containers Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend

# Check if ports are in use
netstat -tlnp | grep 3001
netstat -tlnp | grep 80

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart
```

### Can't Access Application
- Check containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Test backend health: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`
- Test frontend: `curl http://localhost:80`
- Check firewall settings

### Database Issues
```bash
# View database files
docker-compose exec backend ls -la /app/data

# Reset database (⚠️ deletes all data)
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

**More help:** See the [wiki](../../wiki) for detailed documentation, admin guides, and API reference.
